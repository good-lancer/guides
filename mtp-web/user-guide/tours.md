# Tours

Depending on how you shot your imagery, it is likely you will have a number of sequences with some relationship to a location.

For example, if you take photos of a local park as a series of individual time lapses / Sequences \(e.g. one timelapse per path\). These Sequences are all related and it makes sense to group them together under the name of the park. This is what you can do with Tours
