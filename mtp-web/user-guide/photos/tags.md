# Tags

### About

It is useful to have a human searchable record of what is inside an image. For example; show me all photos that contain cars.

This is where Photo Tags come in.

### Types of tags

There are two types of photo tags you will come across in Map the Paths Web:

1. Mapillary Object tags: these are tags auto-extracted by Mapillary technology. [You can read more about these types of tags and where they come from in the developer docs](../../developer-docs/functions/photos.md#get-mapillary-photo-object-data).
2. MTP Object tags: these are tags that have been added to images manually by Map the Paths users. These types of tags are covered in this article.

### Viewing MTP Object tags

\[ADD image\]

When in Photo view, you will see all object tags \(both Mapillary and MTP tags\) in the sidebar. Clicking a tag will highlight that object\(s\) in the photo viewer.

### Creating MTP Object tags

You might notice objects that have not been tagged in an image

### Challenges and MTP Object tags
